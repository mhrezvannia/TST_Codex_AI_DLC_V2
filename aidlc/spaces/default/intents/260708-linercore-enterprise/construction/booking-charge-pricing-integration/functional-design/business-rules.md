# Business Rules - Booking Charge Pricing Integration

## Source Context

This artifact consumes unit-of-work.md, unit-of-work-story-map.md, requirements.md, components.md, component-methods.md, services.md, and functional-design-questions.md.

The accepted recommended answers keep booking-charge-pricing-integration within its approved boundary and require real evidence before completion.

## Ownership Rules

- booking-charge-pricing-integration owns Booking to Charge pricing request/response seam, OpenAPI/Pact expectations, idempotency, timeout/retry/circuit breaker behavior, and pricing snapshot handoff.
- booking-charge-pricing-integration must not perform Charge calculation or let Booking own pricing rules.
- Public behavior must trace to unit-of-work.md, unit-of-work-story-map.md, requirements.md, components.md, component-methods.md, and services.md.
- Service interactions must use approved OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Avro, Pact, message-pact, or typed client contracts where applicable.

## Validation Rules

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| VAL-001 | Inputs must validate identity/security context, required reference data, correlation, and idempotency where applicable. |
| VAL-002 | Boundary violations fail closed and are visible in tests/review evidence. |
| VAL-003 | Exceptions must be auditable and surfaced to the owning workflow. |
| VAL-004 | Completion cannot be claimed from documents, mock screens, hardcoded results, or containers merely starting. |

## Evidence Rules

- Unit tests cover core logic and boundary failures.
- Integration or contract tests cover external seams.
- Local runtime compatibility is documented where applicable.
- Observability hooks preserve correlation across HTTP/events/logs/traces where applicable.
- UI evidence uses real APIs/events and does not own business rules unless this is the UI unit.
