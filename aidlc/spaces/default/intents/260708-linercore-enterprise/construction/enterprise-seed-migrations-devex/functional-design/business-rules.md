# Business Rules - Enterprise Seed Migrations Devex

## Source Context

This artifact consumes unit-of-work.md, unit-of-work-story-map.md, requirements.md, components.md, component-methods.md, services.md, and functional-design-questions.md.

The accepted recommended answers keep enterprise-seed-migrations-devex within its approved boundary and require real evidence before completion.

## Ownership Rules

- enterprise-seed-migrations-devex owns logical database/user setup, migration orchestration, deterministic seed data, reset flows, and developer command documentation.
- enterprise-seed-migrations-devex must not replace real business implementation with seed fixtures or allow cross-service SQL joins.
- Public behavior must trace to unit-of-work.md, unit-of-work-story-map.md, requirements.md, components.md, component-methods.md, and services.md.
- Service interactions must use approved OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Avro, Pact, message-pact, or typed client contracts where applicable.

## Validation Rules

| Rule | Statement |
|---|---|
| VAL-001 | Inputs must validate identity/security context, required reference data, correlation, and idempotency where applicable. |
| VAL-002 | Boundary violations fail closed and are visible in tests/review evidence. |
| VAL-003 | Exceptions must be auditable and surfaced to the owning workflow. |
| VAL-004 | Completion cannot be claimed from documents, mock screens, hardcoded results, or containers merely starting. |

## Evidence Rules

- Unit tests cover core logic and boundary failures.
- Integration or contract tests cover external seams.
- Local runtime compatibility is documented where applicable.
- Observability hooks preserve correlation across HTTP/events/logs/traces where applicable.
- UI evidence uses real APIs/events and does not own business rules unless this is the UI unit.
